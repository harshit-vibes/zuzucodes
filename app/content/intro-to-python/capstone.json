  "description": "# Capstone: Quote Fetcher\n\nYou've mastered Python fundamentals. Now put it all together.\n\nUsing the `requests` library, write a script that fetches a random quote from a public API, formats it nicely, and prints it to the terminal.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Fetch from `https://zenquotes.io/api/random`\n- Print the quote text and author in a readable format\n- Handle the case where the request fails gracefully",
  "starter_code": "import requests\n\n# Fetch a random quote and print it\ndef main():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\nmain()\n",
  "required_packages": ["requests"],
  "hints": [
    "Use requests.get(url) to fetch the URL. Check response.status_code == 200 before proceeding.",
    "The API returns a JSON array. Use response.json() to parse it, then access [0]['q'] for the quote and [0]['a'] for the author.",
    "Wrap your main() call in a try/except block to handle network errors gracefully."
  ]
